I am Harish, A consulting Data Analytics professional and a Chemical and Biological Engineer. I am passionate about working with organisations that want to use their data effectively. By proactively leading the first ideas around creating Key Performance metrics (KPI), establishing accurate data capturing, and applying a range of analytical techniques from descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive, while concerning Data Governance and management, all the way to impactful insights or tools. In addition, I can assist and support in any stage of the organisation's technology transformation to make evidence-driven decisions to meet long-term strategies. 

This passion project is intended to showcase my learning experience in the world of Data Science, Engineering and Analytics. The purpose of this project is to address the limitations around the stock exchange data accessibility for analysis as a commoner. As an analytical specialist, I would prefer to make concrete, evidence-based investments by analysing data as a whole market and making the data set readily available for in-depth analysis via state-of-the-art technologies, such as cloud suit (azure), python, R, pyspark, Azure ML, etc. Therefore, this project attempts to democratise the data for better investment strategies and empower the commoner to participate in the open market.
